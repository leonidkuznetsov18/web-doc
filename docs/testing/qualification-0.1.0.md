# Release qualification — 0.1.0

This is the sanitized local qualification result for `@zrimo/viewer@0.1.0` on
2026-07-17. It contains no private input names, hashes, document text,
screenshots, or derived documents. No npm publish, Git tag, GitHub Release, or
Pages deployment was performed.

## Result

The stable `0.1.0` candidate passes the repository, runtime, browser, fidelity,
security, packaging, and documentation gates. `release-status.json` and the
pack report both mark it as ready.

Machine-readable evidence is stored in `artifacts/`: browser capabilities,
fidelity, fuzz, performance, SPDX SBOM, size, vulnerability, and pack reports.
The exact release tarball and checksum are generated only in ignored `.cache`
until the authorized publication workflow stages them.
